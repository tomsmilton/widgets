                    <h2>Initial Concept Exploration</h2>
                    
                    <p>Our investigation began with an analysis of existing solutions, particularly Clean Air Kits designs that use PC cooling fans to power air filtration. We identified several opportunities for improvement:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using larger fans (140mm vs 120mm) that could operate at lower RPM for the same airflow</li>
                        <li>Optimizing the fan arrangement to improve performance</li>
                        <li>Creating a more aesthetically pleasing and office-appropriate design</li>
                        <li>Reducing overall cost</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Initial CAD concepts were developed based on a box-like structure with multiple PC fans and standard air conditioning filters.</p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="airfilter_images/image.png" alt="Initial CAD concept with PC fans and AC filters" class="article-image" style="max-height: 45vh; width: auto;">
                        <div class="image-caption">Figure 1: Initial CAD concept with PC fans and AC filters</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Clean Air Kits units use MPR 1900 AC filters, which are readily available at approximately £45 each with a recommended replacement interval of 9 months. These filters provide good filtration area at a reasonable cost.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <p>To properly select fans and design the system, we needed to understand the pressure-flow relationship of our filters. Testing revealed that our filters followed this pressure curve:</p>

                    <div class="blueprint-section">
                        <div class="blueprint-title">FILTER PRESSURE EQUATION</div>
                        <pre>P = 142 × Q^{1.39}

Where:
P = pressure in Pascals
Q = flow rate in m³/s</pre>
                    </div>

                            <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="airfilter_images/image%201.png" alt="Filter pressure drop curve" class="article-image">
                        <div class="image-caption">Figure 2: Filter pressure drop curve</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>For our target flow rate of 1000m³/hr through a single filter, this would create a pressure loss of approximately 23.9Pa. With two filters in parallel (each handling 500m³/hr), the pressure loss would drop to approximately 9.13Pa per filter.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sound Level Considerations</h3>
                    
                    <p>Fan noise increases non-linearly with the number of fans. For n fans, the total sound pressure level can be calculated as:</p>

                    <div class="blueprint-section">
                        <div class="blueprint-title">NOISE CALCULATION</div>
                        <pre>L_{total} = L_{single} + 10log_{10}(n)

Where:
L_{total} = total noise level (dBA)
L_{single} = single fan noise level (dBA)
n = number of fans</pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>Another important factor is the relationship between fan speed and noise. Testing and literature showed that noise increases with the fifth power of speed:</p>

                    <div class="blueprint-section">
                        <div class="blueprint-title">NOISE-SPEED RELATIONSHIP</div>
                        <pre>Noise = 10 × log_{10}((v/v_{max})^5)

Where:
v = operating speed
v_{max} = maximum speed</pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="image-container">

                    </div>

                    <p>This means that running fans at 80% speed instead of 100% reduces noise by approximately 5dB—a substantial improvement in perceived loudness.</p>

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h2>Fan Performance Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <p>We conducted a detailed analysis of several fan options to determine the optimal choice. For the P14 Max fans, we created visualizations showing the relationship between number of fans, noise level, and flow rate:</p>

                    <p>Our investigation into speaker cloth revealed a significant concern: additional pressure loss. Based on analysis, typical speaker cloth could create 15-20Pa of pressure loss, which was even higher than the pressure loss from our filters (9.13Pa)!</p>

                    <p>If using speaker cloth, we would need to increase its surface area and add distance between it and the fans to minimize pressure loss:</p>

                    <p>Our most significant finding was that multiple smaller units would outperform a single large unit due to the nonlinear relationship between pressure and airflow. This led us to pivot from a single large "radiator" design to two smaller cabinet-style units, each with two filters and 8 fans per unit.</p>

                        <pre>
✓ Airflow of 741 CFM (1260m³/hr) without fabric covering
✓ Noise levels under 30dBA at operating speed
✓ Total cost ~£600 for two units (< 50% of commercial alternatives)
✓ Easily serviceable design with simple filter replacement
✓ Modern, minimalist aesthetic appropriate for office environments</pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>The most significant findings from this project were:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Multiple smaller units are more efficient than one large unit due to the nonlinear relationship between pressure and flow</li>
                        <li>PC cooling fans provide an excellent balance of performance, noise, and cost for this application</li>
                        <li>Filter covering materials have a dramatically larger impact on performance than initially expected</li>
                        <li>A systematic, data-driven approach to fan selection and system design produces superior results compared to intuition-based design</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Future work should address the Arctic F14 PWM PST fans end-of-life status, which highlights a risk with consumer/gaming-grade components. Future designs should consider industrial components with longer availability guarantees.</p>
