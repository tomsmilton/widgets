                    <p>Amodo Design partnered with Corryn Biotechnologies to create a novel handheld high-voltage electrospinning device. This groundbreaking product aims to enable clinicians to use electrospinning technology directly at the bedside.</p>

                        <pre>
> Industrial Partner:     Corryn Biotechnologies
> Development Scope:      Lab prototype to MVP
> Key Challenge:          Safety-critical 10s of kilovolts in handheld form factor

                    <p>Academic groups have spent decades developing new materials and techniques for electrospinning. By applying 10s of kilovolts to a polymer solution, scientists can create a microfibre or nanofibre mesh - similar to a spider's web, but with much finer threads. This technology is already used on industrial manufacture lines to make everything from respiratory masks to implantable medical devices, but it is yet to reach wide scale adoption in the clinic.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
                    
                    <p>For this project we formed an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, electronic, firmware, and software engineers to work collaboratively on the complex, interlinking requirements of the device.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>One bottleneck to medical applications for this technology has been the portability and usability of the electrospinning hardware. Creating a handheld device that can provide 10s of kilovolts is a complex, safety-critical challenge that required our multidisciplinary approach.</p>

                    <h2>High-Voltage Safety Critical Design</h2>
                    
                    <p>High voltage electricity introduces complexity throughout the stack; not only are there strict user safety requirements but there are also complex EMI considerations.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>At the start of the project we ran comprehensive electrical breakdown tests on all of the possible materials we might use for the device. Characterising how well they insulate from high voltages in the 10s of kilovolts range enabled the mechanical engineers to then proceed with certainty that their designs would prevent electrical breakdown.</p>

                        <div class="blueprint-title">SAFETY INNOVATIONS</div>
                        <pre>
> Material Testing:       Comprehensive electrical breakdown tests
> Protective Systems:     Complete grounding shield for user protection
> Encapsulation:          Critical subsystems potting to prevent electrical breakdown
> EMI Management:         Careful PCB layout and component selection for noise reduction
> Verification:           Rigorous testing protocol for high-voltage safety</pre>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>To further protect users we potted critical subsystems to both prevent electrical breakdown and prevent shorts and designed a complete grounding shield to protect the user.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not only does high voltage present a set of complex constraints for user safety, but it also leads to electrical design requirements throughout the electronic systems, in particular it is essential to protect ICs from electrical noise that may interfere with their performance. Careful component selection, PCB layout, and rigorous testing meant that we were able to produce electronic systems that were safe from high voltage noise.</p>

                    <p>We developed the MVP system in just three months. To achieve this we brought much of the prototyping in-house. Our team's ability to quickly iterate on designs is essential for rapid product development.</p>
                    
                    <p>When working on complex electromechanical systems it is essential that the product design, mechanical design, electronics, firmware, and software all perfectly interface. Small changes in one system can lead to cascading changes through the rest of the product. At Amodo we have all of these capabilities under one roof. This means that we can more quickly and more accurately develop complex products.</p>

                        <p>"Amodo brought our device from lab-scale prototype to minimum-viable product at great pace. We'd certainly recommend Amodo to other companies looking to bring complex devices out of the laboratory and into the hands of consumers."</p>

                    <p>Not only does this improve product outcomes but it also reduces the complexity of project management for our clients. Working with a single design group is faster and easier than coordinating work between a set of different suppliers.</p>
